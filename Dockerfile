# Copy dependency files
COPY package*.json ./
# The wildcard * matches both package.json and package-lock.json (or package-lock.yaml in case of other package managers like pnpm/yarn).
# This is a common pattern to avoid writing two separate COPY commands.
RUN npm ci
# is used to install Node.js project dependencies in a clean, consistent, and repeatable way, based on your package-lock.json
# üö® Requirements for npm ci

# package-lock.json must exist.

# If node_modules/ already exists, npm ci deletes it before installing.

# If you don‚Äôt have a lockfile, npm ci will fail.
# The COPY . . command will copy all the files and subdirectories (including .env, src/, public/, etc.)
#  from /DOCKER-REACT (or the current directory where docker build is run)
#  into the /app directory inside the container.
COPY . .
# üìÅ "Copy everything in the current folder on my local machine (except things in .dockerignore)."
# is short but powerful ‚Äî it copies the entire contents of your local build context (project folder) into the current working directory inside the Docker image.
# üì¶ "Put those copied files into /usr/src/app inside the Docker image."
# Build the React app (outputs to /usr/src/app/build by default)
